# Project_RL
Implementation of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient ([DDPG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)) and Maximum A Posteriori
Policy Optimization ([MPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06920)) Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for continuous 
control on [OpenAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) environments.

## Prerequisites
To use the Algorithms will require python3 (>=3.6.5), OpenAI gym and the 
Quanser environments.

Installlation gym: https://github.com/openai/gym

Installation quanser: https://git.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/quanser/clients/tree/master

Additionally [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), [Numpy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html), 
[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install), 
[TensorboardX](https://tensorboardx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) are needed.
