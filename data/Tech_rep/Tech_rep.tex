\begin{abstract}
The model-free algorithms \textit{Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient} (DDPG) and \textit{Maximum A Posteriori Policy Optimization} (MPO) have been implemented and tested on a variety of tasks. First they were tested in an virtual environment after which they were evaluated using real robots. This paper contains the implementation details, specific variations from the original algorithms and a detailed evaluation section. Evaluations have been carried out with focus on the hyper-parameter settings for each individual algorithm and experiment. This paper supplements the reports of many other research groups at the TU Darmstadt to found an extensive summary of RL algorithms on a variety of popular RL environments.
