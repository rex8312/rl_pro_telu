\section{Evaluation}
The following section summarizes the performance of the previously described algorithms (section \ref{sec_algorihtms}) for the three environments. Thereby, the choice of parameters as well as the difference between the evaluation on the virtual and real environment will be of importance. The evaluation procedure in this section is as follows:\\
\textit{First}, the learning procedure as well as the evaluation is carried out in the virtual environment which serves as a baseline. \textit{Secondly}, the learned models will be evaluated on the real robots. \textit{Thirdly}, learning and evaluation will be carried out on the real robot.
The following table represents hyper-parameter settings which are constant for all environments:
